Although no longer professionally active, as a kid from the age of 5 to 15, I had the pleasure of participating in national (Albania) and international chess competitions with players (Erald Dervishi, Arben Dardha, Altin Cela, Dritan Mehmeti, Llambi Qendro) who have now become masters and grandmasters. Nowadays you can occasionally catch me on <a href="chess.com">chess.com</a> playing Blitz (highest ELO: 2463).
