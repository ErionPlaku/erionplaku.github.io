	<strong>Program Management:</strong>	
	Dr. Plaku co-leads the National AI Research Institutes program,
a flagship federal initiative at the forefront of AI research and innovation. Driving collaboration among academia, industry,
and government, this nationwide network of 27 AI Institutes advances both foundational breakthroughs and use-inspired AI research,
tackling critical challenges and shaping the future of AI. Supported by multiple federal agencies and industry partners,
the program accelerates transformative discoveries and strengthens the nationâ€™s leadership in AI.
In addition, Dr. Plaku
 is a program director for the CISE/IIS/Robust Intelligence
 program, which focuses on developing AI systems that are
 resilient and adaptable to real-world challenges. Dr. Plaku was
 also instrumental in advancing robotics research at NSF,
 co-leading the Foundational Research in Robotics (FRR) program,
 the agency's flagship initiative in robotics. He also co-chaired
 the Interagency Working Group on Intelligent Robotics and
 Autonomous Systems (IRAS), coordinating federal R&D efforts
 across multiple agencies to accelerate progress in robotics and
 autonomous systems. In addition, Dr. Plaku played a key role in
 the advancement of international collaborations, engaging with
 organizations such as Japan's Science and Technology Agency and
 the UK's Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council.

Dr. Plaku's research seeks to increase the ability of robots to <em>plan</em> and <em>act</em> on their
own or assist in human-machine cooperative tasks. The long-term goal is to make the supervision of robots
similar to that of humans so as to increase productivity and capabilities. This research brings together concepts from robotics, AI, machine learning, and logic to
develop planning frameworks that enable supervisors to describe tasks in high-level 
languages and have such frameworks  plan the actions and motions for robots to safely complete their assigned tasks.
The research approach follows a full cycle from algorithmic development
and theoretical analysis to software implementation, field testing, and deployment. Targeted applications 
include <em>marine robotics,  
logistic operations, aerial robotics, medical robotics</em>, and <em>cyber-physical systems</em>.
